 # ARsenal

## Description
A mobile augmented reality repair assistant that helps users fix laptops and everyday electronics using guided visual instructions. The system identifies devices through the phone camera, locates faulty components, and provides step-by-step repair guidance in real time.

## Problem
Device repair is often avoided due to high costs, lack of parts, and complex repair procedures. As a result, many users replace devices instead of fixing them, leading to unnecessary expense and electronic waste.

## Solution
The application provides:
- Automatic device identification using the camera
- Fault detection and component recognition
- Step-by-step AR-based repair instructions
- Real-time safety warnings and error prevention
- Tool and replacement part guidance
- Optional remote expert support

## Target Users
